# SCR-Benchmark-SCSR
This repository contains the results of **shape-constrained symbolic regression (SCSR)** on datasets of our shape-constrained regression benchmark [SCR-Benchmark](https://github.com/prescriptiveanalytics/SCR-Benchmarks).


## Shape-constrained symbolic regression (SCSR)
For SCSR we use the implementation of [HeuristicLab](https://dev.heuristiclab.com/trac.fcgi/) as described in [Kronberger et al.](https://direct.mit.edu/evco/article/30/1/75/99840/Shape-Constrained-Symbolic-Regression-Improving).
